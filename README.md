(3) Acknowledgement: The code is revised based on CRFchain by "Mark Schmidt and Kevin Swersky" (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/crfChain.html). Hence the code of PR-CRF have similar structure with CRFchain. <br>
(4) Notes on the input feature matrix (X):  We have revised the PR-CRF code to deal with ordinal features, which makes the representation of input feature matrix (X) is somewhat different from the CRFchain.
